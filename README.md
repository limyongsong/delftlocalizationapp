# delftlocalizationapp
Academic Project for Localization using Android phone
-----------------------------------------------------
The project leads up from IN4254__Assignment_1.pdf to IN4254__Assignment_3-1.pdf (which is the final report for the project)
-----------------------------------------------------
The project aims to let the student understand more about how KNN, naive bayes and particle filter works 
by working on an android application that is able to detect where the user is located on a specific level (where it is split up into 16 cells) on the TUDelft EWI building.
